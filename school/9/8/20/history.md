<hr>

 ➡**Directions:** In the space below answer the following questions in paragraph form.
  

 Question: **Should we study history? Why or why not?**
 **Response:**

​		Yeah, I think we should study history. We could learn about all sorts of stuff, we could learn about how the word as we know it came to be, we can also learn from our history like where past civilisations went wrong. There's so much to learn from history, and it's also just fascinating to hear about how people were before!

 **Document 1**



 In 1492, a sailor named Christopher Columbus sailed west from Europe hoping to find a direct route to Asia. The voyage was funded by Isabella and Ferdinand, the King and Queen of Spain. They hoped to gain power and wealth if Columbus was successful. Instead of finding a route to Asia, Columbus landed on islands in the Caribbean. The following is an excerpt of a letter Columbus wrote to Lord Raphael Sanchez, Isabella and Ferdinand’s royal Treasurer who was responsible for managing Spain’s money. 

> ​	Knowing that it will afford you pleasure to learn that I have brought my undertaking to a successful termination [end], I have decided upon writing you this letter to acquaint [inform] you with all the events which have occurred in my voyage, and the discoveries which have resulted from it. 	 
>
> ​	Thirty-three days after my departure from Cadiz I reached the Indian sea, where I discovered many islands, thickly peopled, of which I took possession without resistance in the name of our most illustrious Monarch [King Ferdinand]...
>
>
> ….On my arrival at that sea, I had taken some Indians by force from the first island that I came to, in order that they might learn our language, and communicate to us what they knew respecting the country; which plan succeeded excellently, and was a great advantage to us, for in a short time, either by gestures and signs, or by words, we were enabled to understand each other. These men are still travelling with me, and although they have been with us now a long time, they continue to entertain the idea that I have descended from heaven; and on our arrival at any new place they published this, crying out immediately with a loud voice to the other Indians, “Come, come and look upon beings of a celestial [godly] race”: upon which both women and men, children and adults, young men and old, when they got rid of the fear they at first entertained, would come out in throngs, crowding the roads to see us, some bringing food, others drink, with astonishing affection and kindness. 
>
> ​	….I promise, that with a little assistance afforded me by our most invincible sovereigns [King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella], I will procure [get] them as much gold as they need, as great a quantity of spices, of cotton... and as many men for the service of the navy as their Majesties may require. I promise also rhubarb and other sorts of drugs….

​	Letter from Christopher Columbus to Raphael Sanchez, March 14, 1493 from *Select letters of Christopher Columbus: with other original documents, relating to his four voyages to the New World*, translated and edited by Richard Henry. Major, 1847 found on archive.org



1. Using document 1, explain how audience affects the way Christopher Columbus writes about his voyage. [1] 

   ​	I think because it's supposed to be a private message to the king and queen, he did not try to disguise the fact that he basically kidnapped and stole from them.

 **Document 1**



 The **Black Death**, also known as the **Black Plague**, was a devastating disease that started in China and spread to large portions of Asia, the Middle East, and Europe in the 14th century (1300s). In Europe, it killed between ⅓ and ⅔ of the population, depending on the region. In total around the world, at least 75 million people were killed by the disease in the mid 1300s.

 **Document 2**

 **I**n 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed west across the Atlantic Ocean and landed in the West Indies. As a result of his journey, Europeans from countries like Portugal, England, Spain, and France wanted to take over the Americas which was controlled by Native Americans. Contact between Europeans and Native Americans increased, sometimes through trade and sometimes through conflict. When Europeans came to the Americas they brought diseases with them that the people living in the Americas had never encountered. Smallpox was the most deadly of those diseases and contributed to the information presented in the graph below.

 **Document 3**

​	In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that started in southeastern China spread around the world infecting 8000 people in 26 countries. SARS was most likely transmitted from a live animal sold at a market in southeast China to humans in November, 2002 and spread amongst the population in that region. On February 21, 2003 a doctor from that part of China spent one night in a hotel in Hong Kong, where he transmitted the disease to sixteen other guests. Those guests took planes to other places which led to outbreaks in Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam. Withing weeks SARS had infected people in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and most of Central , East, and Southeast Asia.

​	Arrows in the map below show the paths followed by the virus in the transmission of the infection from Hong Kong to the other countries. The thickness of the arrows represents the probability associated to a given path.Two different colors are used: black for paths that transmit the virus directly from the seed – Hong Kong – to the first level of infected countries; gray for paths that start from the first level of infected countries.
